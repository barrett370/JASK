# University Staff

Demographic: University Staff

This interview was conducted with a member of staff at the university who has experience with the current occupancy system.

Q: Have you ever used the current system for checking room capacity? If so, how regularly do you use this system?

A: I have tried using the system several times.

Q: What do you like about the current system?

A: Not much, most of the rooms listed are primarily for students so doesnâ€™t relate to myself or my colleagues.

Q: What do you not like about the current system?

A: It seems that the majority of the time the service is down whenever I have tried it.

Q: Does the current system offer all rooms you would like or are there any more rooms you would like it to extend to?

A: It would be very useful to extend to meeting rooms in departmental buildings so I can easily check if a room is being used or not even when there are no scheduled meetings.

Q: Are there anymore improvements that you would suggest to this system?

A: It would be really useful to be able to see what are the busiest times so I know when is the best time to visit a room during the day.

Q: What devices will you most likely check on for a revised room occupancy system?

A: Primarily on my computer.

From this interview with a university staff member, it can be seen that extending the system to more than just study spaces and reliability are the main points to improve on from the current system.
