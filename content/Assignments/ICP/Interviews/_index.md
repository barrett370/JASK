## [Students](/assignments/icp/interviews/student)

The students of Universities implementing ROT systems are the major users and as such their views should play a pivotal role in the design and implementation of such systems. From the interview conducted [here](/assignments/icp/interviews/student) we can see that the current system fails to live up to the expectation of the main user-group, leaving a lot of room for improvement for our service.
