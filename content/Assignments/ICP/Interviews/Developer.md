# Developer 

This interview was conducted with a software developer who has experience developing on top of a range of IoT devices. 

I: What possible applications could you see for an API based on top of this project?

D: I could imagine a whole array of projects, this sort of data could be linked in with a wide array of functionality when it comes to actual use of the buildings. For example you could make something where if someone is looking for a study space it will tell them which ones are free, so they don't have to spend their vital time searching for a space to sit. I can think of a whole range of applications where estates could take advantage of this data. I can imagine that room occupancy has strong correlations with other factors which they try to manage such as temperature or CO2 levels. For example if a room is very full, the amount of CO2 in a room may increase and to combat this the software could auto open windows.

I: Do you see this technology coming in useful for research?

D: Oh definitely, like I hinted about above there are loads of correlations which I suspect exist but could be proven using data from this method. This data would be able to be used for loads of different types of research looking at different trends and so on, I'm not a researcher so I would know exactly, but I can definitely see the potential. Even something like design of buildings, I know a lot of thought goes into the flow of people through a building during the design stage, but with this data it will help back up or prove assumptions about how building design affects movement of people.

I: What do you find important when developing with an API?

D: For me documentation is really important. Having good, clean, easy to read documentation makes a huge difference. Other than that just a naming scheme for your API that makes sense and can be easily guessed. Also having consistency in your API structure is very important. You don't want some commands to be plural and some to be singular. That I do find infuriating.  

I: What do you find limiting about a poor API?

D: Like I said above, lack of consistency and naming choices which are not exactly obvious. Also lack of flexibility. There is nothing worse than a super rigid API which you have to pull more data than you really need just to have to do loads of processing on your side. But also not too much flexibility where it comes confusing. I know that sounds contradictory but I guess just focus on making the main features robust and easy to use but also add in extra super flexible options to the side for the power users.

I: Is the GUI of developer tools important to you?

D: I wouldn’t say that it's essential, I have dealt with numerous APIs in the past that don't have a gui. There are some nice gui’s for apis out there. For example ones that help you build your queries and some that graph statistics about the queries which your users use.
