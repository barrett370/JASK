## Analysis

Of those respondents that do not use the current system, the majority did not because they were not aware of its existence. This is an issue we could address by use of a form of advertisement campaign such as via the University's Instagram or other social media accounts. There were also people identifying with each one of the other options regarding poor service from the current system.

Those who had used the system before but had stopped complained of lack of coverage and lack of useful information such as opening times.

The majority of those who said they currently used the system said they did not like it. The same proportion also said that the current system does not cover all the spaces they regularly use, wanting the system to be extended to areas such as Sloman Lounge or University labs.

100% of respondents who use the system said they had found it to be unavailable before, this raises a significant issue with the reliably of the system, an area we should strive to improve upon.
80% also said they had found the current system to be slow, another area where our solution can offer improvement.

The accuracy of the current system was also challenged with 0% sayign they felt the system was accurate.

People also said they wanted the data to be available to them via a website and mobile app above the other options given to them.
