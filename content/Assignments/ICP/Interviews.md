## Analysis

Of those respondents that do not use the current system, the majority did not because they were not aware of its existence. This is an issue we could address by use of a form of advertisement campaign such as via the University's Instagram or other social media accounts. There were also people identifying with each one of the other options regarding poor service from the current system.

Those who had used the system before but had stopped complained of lack of coverage and lack of useful information such as opening times.

The majority of those who said they currently used the system said they did not like it. The same proportion also said that the current system does not cover all the spaces they regularly use, wanting the system to be extended to areas such as Sloman Lounge or University labs.

100% of respondents who use the system said they had found it to be unavailable before, this raises a significant issue with the reliably of the system, an area we should strive to improve upon.
80% also said they had found the current system to be slow, another area where our solution can offer improvement.

The accuracy of the current system was also challenged with 0% sayign they felt the system was accurate.

People also said they wanted the data to be available to them via a website and mobile app above the other options given to them.


# Developer 

This interview was conducted with a software developer who has experience developing on top of a range of IoT devices. 

I: What possible applications could you see for an API based on top of this project?

D: I could imagine a whole array of projects, this sort of data could be linked in with a wide array of functionality when it comes to actual use of the buildings. For example you could make something where if someone is looking for a study space it will tell them which ones are free, so they don't have to spend their vital time searching for a space to sit. I can think of a whole range of applications where estates could take advantage of this data. I can imagine that room occupancy has strong correlations with other factors which they try to manage such as temperature or CO2 levels. For example if a room is very full, the amount of CO2 in a room may increase and to combat this the software could auto open windows.

I: Do you see this technology coming in useful for research?

D: Oh definitely, like I hinted about above there are loads of correlations which I suspect exist but could be proven using data from this method. This data would be able to be used for loads of different types of research looking at different trends and so on, I'm not a researcher so I would know exactly, but I can definitely see the potential. Even something like design of buildings, I know a lot of thought goes into the flow of people through a building during the design stage, but with this data it will help back up or prove assumptions about how building design affects movement of people.

I: What do you find important when developing with an API?

D: For me documentation is really important. Having good, clean, easy to read documentation makes a huge difference. Other than that just a naming scheme for your API that makes sense and can be easily guessed. Also having consistency in your API structure is very important. You don't want some commands to be plural and some to be singular. That I do find infuriating.  

I: What do you find limiting about a poor API?

D: Like I said above, lack of consistency and naming choices which are not exactly obvious. Also lack of flexibility. There is nothing worse than a super rigid API which you have to pull more data than you really need just to have to do loads of processing on your side. But also not too much flexibility where it comes confusing. I know that sounds contradictory but I guess just focus on making the main features robust and easy to use but also add in extra super flexible options to the side for the power users.

I: Is the GUI of developer tools important to you?

D: I wouldn’t say that it's essential, I have dealt with numerous APIs in the past that don't have a gui. There are some nice gui’s for apis out there. For example ones that help you build your queries and some that graph statistics about the queries which your users use.

# University Staff

This interview was conducted with a member of staff at the university who has experience with the current occupancy system.

Q: Have you ever used the current system for checking room capacity? If so, how regularly do you use this system?

A: I have tried using the system several times.

Q: What do you like about the current system?

A: Not much, most of the rooms listed are primarily for students so doesn’t relate to myself or my colleagues.

Q: What do you not like about the current system?

A: It seems that the majority of the time the service is down whenever I have tried it.

Q: Does the current system offer all rooms you would like or are there any more rooms you would like it to extend to?

A: It would be very useful to extend to meeting rooms in departmental buildings so I can easily check if a room is being used or not even when there are no scheduled meetings.

Q: What devices will you most likely check on for a revised room occupancy system?

A: Primarily on my computer.
