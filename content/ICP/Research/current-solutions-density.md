Density offers a solution to room occupancy monitoring that uses active IR sensors and time of flight (TOF) to detect humans entering and exiting rooms. The overall system boasts 97-99% accuracy.

## Workplace Use Case

Additional features of this solution are security applications, the main being detecting ‘tailgaters’ into buildings. This is where an unauthorised visitor gains access to the building by following an authorised member in. A safety feature that they also offer is employee mustering, being able to detect how many people are in locations in case of evacuation.

Density also prioritises user privacy, quoting that ‘78% of surveyed employees aren’t comfortable with cameras for non-security use cases’. To combat this, density claims that they don’t capture personally identifiable information.

## University Use Case

Density also provides solutions to many higher education institutions offering insights and reporting on overcrowding, smart space allocation based on accurate utillisation data and safety & security measures to monitor capacity and better prepare for emergencies.

This use case can also be integrated into pre-existing applications, so each institution can use Density's platform within their campus apps.

## Cost

One main concern about this solution is the price of implementing it. With sensors costing $495 each and the annual Enterprise Cloud Software License costing $795, cost effectiveness is not a postive trait of this solution. What we will aim to learn from this solution is to provide better value for money by being designed to be a DIY and highly configurable solution.
