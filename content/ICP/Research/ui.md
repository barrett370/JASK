### Introduction

The layout of the UI is something which should be thought about for multiple reasons. The layout will affect what the user interact with and how easily they interact with it. A poorly laid user interface may mean that your best features never get used. In this section we are going to explore the interface for a typical student user.

## What's Important?

It's important that we identify what is important to our user so we can make it avaible to them. According to our research, most of the users dont care about most of the features, they just want to find a space. That's it, any space and they will be sastisfied. 

Some students identified that they wanted to find spaces in specific areas of campus or buildings.

## First things first

As finding any space is the highest important to students, in our design we have decided to put this at the top of the page, right where the user will see when they open the app / website. This section will use an algroithm to detrime which spaces the student should go to based on current/expected occupancy and even possibly taking into account the location of the student. It will then display them clearly in a listed button foramt, dicatating the most important information: space name, building, and occupancy. If the user wants more details they can click on the button and it will take them to a view specifically for that item.
