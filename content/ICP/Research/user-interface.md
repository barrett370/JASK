## Introduction

The user interface is of extreme importance to this project, as it is the portal to which the user will actually experience the product. A user interface is make or break when it comes to a users interactions and impressions of your project. If the data is there but it is tedious to access and presented in ways which are not intuitive and easy to read then people will not want to use your project. An example of this is the universities timetabling system, a system so bad users are happy to hand over their login details to a random party just so they can get out of using it.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Some of the best design at the moment is carried out by the tech giants. Luckily for us these companies have guides on their styles and designs.

Google is leading edge in design and has comprehensive guides on its style along with a number of different tools such as free icons and visually impaired friendly coloured pickers. Along with a whole range of tools which allow for assessing how disability friendly your design is and helping you improve it. 

These resources can be found at https://design.google/resources/. Many other companies have similar style guides.

## Ease

When it comes to UI design our main focus should be around ease of use. This can be achieved by working out which tools are important to the user and putting them as the easiest to get to.

With the idea of ease of use comes cleanliness. Having a clean and simple design can help with ease of use as it means that the user knows exactly where to look for what they need as they are the only things which they can see. Of course you can always go too far in the other direction and make a design which is too clean and in this case you limit the user as it hides the functionality. 

One of the main design principles at the moment is material design. This design can be found across the google suite of products including android. This design methodology strongly follows the idea of clean and simple design in order to help the user. Everything in your design should be intuitive, removing the need for long explanatory tool tips or large manuals.

## Colour 

Colour can often be overlooked as just an aesthetic choice, but colour can play a large role in guiding the user through your interface.
