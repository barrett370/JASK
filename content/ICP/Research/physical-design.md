The aim of the physcial devices is set and forget. Once installed in place they shouldnt need to be touch physically and should be left alone. In this section we will look into possible designs to achieve this.

## Don't touch

A number of methods can be used to make people not tamper with objects. One of these is to make it extremely obivious that you want people not to touch it. This can be acheived by bright "warning colours" such as yellows and red and visible written or iconic warnings such as "DON'T TOUCH". This, whilst effecitve, can be quite distracting, which is not something wanted in stuy spaces where you want people to stay focused on their work. 

Another apporach is amking it so boring that people dont want to touch it and that it blends in with the majority of the other devices around. For our prototype designs we attempted to sketch up devices that are based off existing devices found in these spaces so that they will blend in . The first of these (1) is a device which is meant to look like a powerline adaptor or air freshener. The hope behind this is that people know what these items are and therefore wont be interensted enough in it to mess with it.
