This interview was conducted with a member of staff at the university who has experience with the current occupancy system.

## Have you ever used the current system for checking room capacity? If so, how regularly do you use this system?

 I have tried using the system several times.

## What do you like about the current system?

 Not much, most of the rooms listed are primarily for students so doesnâ€™t relate to myself or my colleagues.

## What do you not like about the current system?

 It seems that the majority of the time the service is down whenever I have tried it.

## Does the current system offer all rooms you would like or are there any more rooms you would like it to extend to?

 It would be very useful to extend to meeting rooms in departmental buildings so I can easily check if a room is being used or not even when there are no scheduled meetings.

## Are there anymore improvements that you would suggest to this system?

 It would be really useful to be able to see what are the busiest times so I know when is the best time to visit a room during the day.

## What devices will you most likely check on for a revised room occupancy system?

 Primarily on my computer.

From this interview with a university staff member, it can be seen that extending the system to more than just study spaces and reliability are the main points to improve on from the current system.
