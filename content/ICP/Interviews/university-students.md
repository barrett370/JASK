## Are you familiar with the current room occupancy system the University implements?

S1: Yes, I've used a library room booking system as well as to check general availability in the Library during study periods.

S2: No - none of my study spaces implement or advertise this.

## What similar systems have you used before?

S1: I interned during the summer at a Tech company which utilised room occupancy to track free space to work and organise meetings.

S2: My part-time job uses vehicle tracking in a car park to alert users to free space.

## Would mobile or web integration be important to you, in such a product.

S1: Absolutely - any sort of web or mobile app integration for study space on campus would be incredibly useful and accessible.

S2: Yes - I think that would be the quickest way to check for a study space - handy also as most students use their phones all the time.

## What ethical concerns do you have about 'Internet of Things' devices that you interact with everyday?

S1: It has become a bit of a joke online - how Google or Amazon's suggestions can mirror your thoughts 
and with assistant products like the Google Home listening to you constantly - I got rid of my assistant for this reason - privacy is essential.

S2: I don't really care as long as my personal information isn't being sold and mined by companies outside of what I gave it away for.

## Would sensors for room occupancy tracking concern you?

S1: As long as it isn't extended to be used to track specific people then it seems okay.

S2: No not really - the concept doesn't seem as intrusive as CCTV and it stores no personal tracking information.

## What features would our product have to have in order for you to use it over current solutions or just not checking availability?

S1: As the main point of use for the product would be in order to save my time, it would have to give me results quickly and accurately.

S2: As long as it's not slow and is easy to access, I would use this device.

## Do you see yourself using this product, should it be implemented in University?

S1: Absolutely. I would use it daily during exam season.

S2: If I am finding it difficult to find a place to work then yes.

These interviews demonstrate how aware current students are of data privacy - how the intended solution should be sleek, unintrusive and accessible - preferably via the web or mobile apps. The results should be accurate in relative real-time and also be fast as the basis for the product is to save time and improve efficiency.
