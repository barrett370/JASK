## Peter : Profile

* Peter doens't have lectures everyday but tries to keep up with outside reading and his assignments in the library - if he doesn't have lectures he will try and spend a couple hours in the library to keep himself productive
* Peter is pretty relaxed about where he sits - as long as he has access to a computer
* Peter can't afford a laptop so library computer access is very important to him
* Peter reads and takes out books a lot - he is a avid user on the library system
* Peter commutes from Redditch - he takes a train and a bus which takes around 50 mins in total one way from home to University
* Peter suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - he needs to sleep for 9 or 10 hours each day to feel energised.

## Peter's Situation

* As the student body has grown, the availibility in the library has decreased
* More and more students use the library - driving the time a student has to get to the library to guarantee a seat earlier and earlier 
* In exam season sometimes you have to arrive at 7am!
* Peter is never up early enough to get a seat in the library and is never aware when there are seats free
* Peter isn't able to use the library as much anymore

## How we could help Peter

* Our product could make Peter aware of other suitable study spaces on campus
* It could give him the most applicable study space - such as ones fitted with general purpose computers.
* It would make Peter aware of the best times to come in
* It could alert Peter when his preferred study space is free
* It would cut down on his time wasted commuting and searching for a seat when coming into campus
* He would no longer commute and find no space for himself
* It would help him study efficiently
