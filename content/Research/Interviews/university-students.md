## Are you familiar with the current room occupancy system the University implements?

S1: Yes, I've used a library room booking system as well as to check general availability in the Library during study periods.

S2: No - none of my study spaces implement or advertise this.

S3: Nah - never heard of it.

S4: I've seen it advertised on the library page but I have never used it - I don't know how really.

S5: I used it once for the main library during study season - it said 30% free but I couldn't find a seat for 40 mins. Haven't used it since.

S6: It's pretty useless for finding a seat - it only says the percentage of full capacity. This doesn't really help me find a place to study.

S7: Yeah I usually check it before I go to the Barnes library - it's not always right but can be a good general indicator.

## What similar systems have you used before?

S1: I interned during the summer at a Tech company which utilised room occupancy to track free space to work and organise meetings.

S2: My part-time job uses vehicle tracking in a car park to alert users to free space.

S3: I've never really used systems like this.

S4: My local library in Brighton has an app that says how free it is.

S5: I don't think I've used this sort of thing before.

S6: Does a cinema seat booking service count? That's obviously something that's quite important for going to the cinema - you can't go if you don't have a seat free.

S7: You can book tables at my local library for group study sessions.

## What did you think of them?

S1: It was really handy for organising meetings with my supervisor and just finding some free space.

S2: I think it's a pretty good system - it stops a lot of traffic building up in the car park.

S3: It would be useful but as I said I haven't used anything like it.

S4: It's good for the Summer, but a lot of time it takes an hour or two to update so it makes it obselete by lunchtime.

S5: n/a

S6: It's pretty essential for the service - but thinking about it, it would be quite handy in my office.

S7: It's handy when available but usually they're booked many weeks in advance.

## Would mobile or web integration be important to you, in such a product?

S1: Absolutely - any sort of web or mobile app integration for study space on campus would be incredibly useful and accessible.

S2: Yes - I think that would be the quickest way to check for a study space - handy also as most students use their phones all the time.

S3: Yeah definitely - I'm always on my phone.

S4: If there were features such as setting push notifications for when space becomes available then it would be excellent.

S5: 

## What ethical concerns do you have about 'Internet of Things' devices that you interact with everyday?

S1: It has become a bit of a joke online - how Google or Amazon's suggestions can mirror your thoughts 
and with assistant products like the Google Home listening to you constantly - I got rid of my assistant for this reason - privacy is essential.

S2: I don't really care as long as my personal information isn't being sold and mined by companies outside of what I gave it away for.

## Would sensors for room occupancy tracking concern you?

S1: As long as it isn't extended to be used to track specific people then it seems okay.

S2: No not really - the concept doesn't seem as intrusive as CCTV and it stores no personal tracking information.

## What features would our product have to have in order for you to use it over current solutions or just not checking availability?

S1: As the main point of use for the product would be in order to save my time, it would have to give me results quickly and accurately.

S2: As long as it's not slow and is easy to access, I would use this device.

## Do you see yourself using this product, should it be implemented in University?

S1: Absolutely. I would use it daily during exam season.

S2: If I am finding it difficult to find a place to work then yes.

# Analysis

These interviews demonstrate how aware current students are of data privacy - how the intended solution should be sleek, unintrusive and accessible - preferably via the web or mobile apps. The results should be accurate in relative real-time and also be fast as the basis for the product is to save time and improve efficiency.
