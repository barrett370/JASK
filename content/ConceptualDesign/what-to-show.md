    Given our research, what information do our potential clients and end-users want to see?
---

From [our research](/research/), we now have a good idea of the short comings of the current system, what the information the users want to see and how they want to see it.

Our users have expressed interest in a simple design showing localised occupancy and opening times. Opening times is simple to show with a table next to the occupancy data for a given space.

Localised occupancy can be shown in a number of ways or perhaps as a combination of multiple formats.

The main goal of our system is to be simple, informative and easy to use. We do not want to present the user with information in formats such as this:

## Heatmap layout


![Heatmap display](/images/uploads/heatmap.png)

This view is very *Tangible* with it being immediately obvious the areas of high density without the need for explicit axis or legends, although one may be included for completeness. One must also consider the case of a colour blind person who may struggle to interpret maps such as the one shown above, instead we may opt for a reduced colour pallette or commit to using multiple different information read-outs including more graphical means.

## Gauge Representation

Gauges are another simple way to show relative occupancy. They clearly show the current status compared to the extremes of 0 or 100%. An array of these gauges would quickly and simply show to users the spaces with the lowest relative occupancy.
