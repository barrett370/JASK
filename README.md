## Netlify CMS

To get setup with Netlify CMS (assuming hosting is already working) should just be a case of:

1. configuring [Identity access](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#enable-identity-and-git-gateway) with it restricted to invite only.
2. Invite members under the **Identity** tab on the Netlify project
