<p>Student A: Yes, I&rsquo;ve used a library room booking system as well as to check general availability in the Library during study periods.</p>
<p>Student B: No - none of my study spaces implement or advertise this.</p>
<p>Student C: Nah - never heard of it.</p>
<p>Student D: I&rsquo;ve seen it advertised on the library page but I have never used it - I don&rsquo;t know how really.</p>
<p>Student E: I used it once for the main library during study season - it said 30% free but I couldn&rsquo;t find a seat for 40 mins. Haven&rsquo;t used it since.</p>
<p>Student F: It&rsquo;s pretty useless for finding a seat - it only says the percentage of full capacity. This doesn&rsquo;t really help me find a place to study.</p>
<p>Student G: Yeah I usually check it before I go to the Barnes library - it&rsquo;s not always right but can be a good general indicator.</p>
<h4 id="what-similar-systems-have-you-used-before">What similar systems have you used before?</h4>
<p>Student A: I interned during the summer at a Tech company which utilised room occupancy to track free space to work and organise meetings.</p>
<p>Student B: My part-time job uses vehicle tracking in a car park to alert users to free space.</p>
<p>Student C: I&rsquo;ve never really used systems like this.</p>
<p>Student D: My local library in Brighton has an app that says how free it is.</p>
<p>Student E: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve used this sort of thing before.</p>
<p>Student F: Does a cinema seat booking service count? That&rsquo;s obviously something that&rsquo;s quite important for going to the cinema - you can&rsquo;t go if you don&rsquo;t have a seat free.</p>
<p>Student G: You can book tables at my local library for group study sessions.</p>
<h4 id="what-did-you-think-of-them">What did you think of them?</h4>
<p>Student A: It was really handy for organising meetings with my supervisor and just finding some free space.</p>
<p>Student B: I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good system - it stops a lot of traffic building up in the car park.</p>
<p>Student C: It would be useful but as I said I haven&rsquo;t used anything like it.</p>
<p>Student D: It&rsquo;s good for the Summer, but a lot of time it takes an hour or two to update so it makes it obselete by lunchtime.</p>
<p>Student E: n/a</p>
<p>Student F: It&rsquo;s pretty essential for the service - but thinking about it, it would be quite handy in my office.</p>
<p>Student G: It&rsquo;s handy when available but usually they&rsquo;re booked many weeks in advance.</p>
<h4 id="would-mobile-or-web-integration-be-important-to-you-in-such-a-product">Would mobile or web integration be important to you, in such a product?</h4>
<p>Student A: Absolutely - any sort of web or mobile app integration for study space on campus would be incredibly useful and accessible.</p>
<p>Student B: Yes - I think that would be the quickest way to check for a study space - handy also as most students use their phones all the time.</p>
<p>Student C: Yeah definitely - I&rsquo;m always on my phone.</p>
<p>Student D: If there were features such as setting push notifications for when space becomes available then it would be excellent.</p>
<p>Student E: Not really, I don&rsquo;t use my phone much - especially during my study time.</p>
<p>Student F: Yeah I would really like that idea.</p>
<p>Student G: If it was reliable. Most mobile apps aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<h4 id="what-ethical-concerns-do-you-have-about-internet-of-things-devices-that-you-interact-with-everyday">What ethical concerns do you have about &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo; devices that you interact with everyday?</h4>
<p>Student A: It has become a bit of a joke online - how Google or Amazon&rsquo;s suggestions can mirror your thoughts
and with assistant products like the Google Home listening to you constantly - I got rid of my assistant for this reason - privacy is essential.</p>
<p>Student B: I don&rsquo;t really care as long as my personal information isn&rsquo;t being sold and mined by companies outside of what I gave it away for.</p>
<p>Student C: I saw that thing about Huawei in the news - something about tracking all your data on your phone. That&rsquo;s why I have an iPhone.</p>
<p>Student D: I don&rsquo;t use any IoT devices.</p>
<p>Student E: I try and keep my privacy to the maximum - I&rsquo;ve switched from Whatsapp to telegram for encrypted communications etc. I am quite concerned with the directions we are
going with digital assistants.</p>
<p>Student F: I&rsquo;m really not that fussed - I don&rsquo;t have anything to hide. I love Siri and use it daily.</p>
<p>Student G: As long as they don&rsquo;t store my personal stuff then I&rsquo;m okay with it.</p>
<h4 id="would-sensors-for-room-occupancy-tracking-concern-you">Would sensors for room occupancy tracking concern you?</h4>
<p>Student A: As long as it isn&rsquo;t extended to be used to track specific people then it seems okay.</p>
<p>Student B: No not really - the concept doesn&rsquo;t seem as intrusive as CCTV and it stores no personal tracking information.</p>
<p>Student C: Not at all.</p>
<p>Student D: I would prefer not to be tracked but as long as it can&rsquo;t be used to identify people then it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Student E: Not really - I would be concerned with cameras.</p>
<p>Student F: No</p>
<p>Student G: Yeah - if they were taking loads of photos I wouldn&rsquo;t really like to go there - I look like trash in the library!</p>
<h4 id="what-features-would-our-product-have-to-have-in-order-for-you-to-use-it-over-current-solutions-or-just-not-checking-availability">What features would our product have to have in order for you to use it over current solutions or just not checking availability?</h4>
<p>Student A: As the main point of use for the product would be in order to save my time, it would have to give me results quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>Student B: As long as it&rsquo;s not slow and is easy to access, I would use this device.</p>
<p>Student C: Maybe predictions for when&rsquo;s best to go to the library?</p>
<p>Student D: As long as it&rsquo;s fast I would use it.</p>
<p>Student E: Notifications - I don&rsquo;t wanna be checking every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Student F: If it does what you&rsquo;re describing - it sounds fine as is.</p>
<p>Student G: Maybe a way to share a specific spot with friends when making study plans?</p>
<h4 id="do-you-see-yourself-using-this-product-should-it-be-implemented-in-university">Do you see yourself using this product, should it be implemented in University?</h4>
<p>Student A: Absolutely. I would use it daily during exam season.</p>
<p>Student B: If I am finding it difficult to find a place to work then yes.</p>
<p>Student C: 100%</p>
<p>Student D: I don&rsquo;t think it would be that useful currently for myself as I work in labs - but for other students I think it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Student E: Yes I would - I&rsquo;m constantly in the library in exam season and spend a lot of time finding a seat, maybe this would make it harder if everyone knows where the free seats are however.</p>
<p>Student F: Yeah definitely - something like that I would use more than Canvas.</p>
<p>Student G: If it worked well - yeah!</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>These interviews demonstrate how aware current students are of data privacy - how the intended solution should be sleek, unintrusive and accessible - preferably via the web or mobile apps. The results should be accurate in relative real-time and also be fast as the basis for the product is to save time and improve efficiency. We also managed to canvas some ideas for the solution and reinforce some of our own previous ideas - multiple students seemed enthusiastic about push notifications for availability and metrics for availibility prediction - these could be promising not only for University environments, but also corporate statistics. For example, examining foottraffic in supermarkets and analysing to predict where to put the biggest money making products.</p>
