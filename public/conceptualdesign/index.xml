      <description>There are 3 major sensor-based approaches we have considered pursuing.
 Entryway traffic-based tracking Per-table based tracking Ambient environment tracking  Notice that all of these approaches are relatively non-invasive, with none requiring the use of cameras.
Entryway traffic tracking This proposed system would work via a doorway mounted laser depth sensor. By mounting the sensor at a (known) angle, we can calculate the direction of travel of an individual. This simple sensor and post-processing algorithm would allow us to maintain a record of entrances and exits from a given doorway and with a backing system aware of the relative positions of the devices, we could extrapolate numbers of people in each building or room.</description>

      <title>What data do we want to show?</title>

      <description>From our research, we now have a good idea of the short comings of the current system, what the information the users want to see and how they want to see it.
Our users have expressed interest in a simple design showing localised occupancy and opening times. Opening times is simple to show with a table next to the occupancy data for a given space.
Localised occupancy can be shown in a number of ways or perhaps as a combination of multiple formats.</description>

      <description>Introduction The user interface is of extreme importance to this project, as it is the portal to which the user will actually experience the product. A user interface is make or break when it comes to a users interactions and impressions of your project. If the data is there but it is tedious to access and presented in ways which are not intuitive and easy to read then people will not want to use your product.</description>
